Mturk Experiment Survey
================================

This site uses Handlebar templates and is a small JavaScript single page app. It is used in an Amazon Mechanical Turk Survey via the Mturk HTML Question structure

The survey asks users about politcians they find most attractive (politicians are displayed in random order and each politician is displayed on a random side of the page). Followed by a question about a voting line picture that is also randomly displayed on either side of the page. Followed by a question about state elections which display one picture. The pictures are displayed in a random order and the input options are also choosen to be on a random side, but the input options are only randomly displayed on a side once - meaning the input options stay on the same side throughout the survey. Next there are a question about tokens which utilizes the jQuery NoUiSlider plugin. The plugin is veyr slightly modified so as to work with the text that slides with the slider.

There are input checks for each page that ensures the user does not continue to the next page without answering a question.
